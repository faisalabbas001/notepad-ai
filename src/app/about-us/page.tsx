			{/* Introduction */}
			<section className="mb-16">
				<p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
					It started with frustration.
				</p>
				<p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
					I needed a quick, simple way to take notes online - something distraction-free, fast, and reliable. But every tool I tried either felt bloated, 
					asked for an account, bombarded me with ads, or missed something essential: it didn't understand how I wanted to write.
				</p>
				<p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
					That's when I realized the real problem wasn't just missing features - it was missing understanding. No tool adapted to how I write. 
					No tool used language as a guide. So I built Notepad AI - a place where writing feels natural, intelligent, and private.
				</p>

					<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-600">Built for Writers, Not Accounts</h2>
					<p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
						You don't have to log in. You don't have to sign up. You just start writing.

					<p className="text-gray-600">
						Notepad AI is designed for people like me - people who value clarity over clutter, ideas over interfaces. 
						It's a notepad that works the moment you need it, without asking anything from you.

					<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-600">NLP at the Core</h2>
					<p className="text-gray-600">
						This isn't just a digital scratchpad. It's powered by Natural Language Processing, which means it understands your writing context as you go. 
						It's aware of structure, tone, and flow - and adapts quietly in the background to support you, not interrupt you.
					</p>
				</section>

				{/* Privacy */}

					<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-600">Writing Should Be Private</h2>
					<p className="text-gray-600">
						Everything happens in your browser. Nothing is stored unless you choose to save it. There's no tracking, no surveillance, and no data mining. 
						Just you and your thoughts - as it should be.

					<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-600">Why I Keep Building It</h2>
					<p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
						Because I still write notes every day.
					</p>
					<p className="text-gray-600">
						And every time someone else uses Notepad AI and tells me, "This is what I needed," it reminds me why I built it in the first place: 
						not to impress anyone, but to solve a real need - simply, intelligently, and without compromise.
